Look at other image to image algorithms. There's a lot. MUNIT, stuff with adain, starganv2, pix2pix... Some paired, some unpaired.
StarGAN is from 2017, v2 is from 2020.
https://paperswithcode.com/task/image-to-image-translation
https://paperswithcode.com/task/unsupervised-image-to-image-translation (unpaired)
https://paperswithcode.com/task/multimodal-unsupervised-image-to-image (multimodal means each source image must be able to produce multiple output images)

Note STARGAN v2. Could try applying similar changes to STARGAN v2
Also look at other benchmarks. AFHQ, celeba-hq, etc.
