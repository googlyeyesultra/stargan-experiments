StarGAN is an algorithm from a 2017 paper which does unpaired image to image translation - that is, given labeled training images (like faces labeled with hair color, gender, etc.), StarGAN can transform images, adding or removing classes (like changing hair color or gender).

In this repository I am experimenting with modern GAN techniques using the original StarGAN as a test bed.

Because this is a solo project with a lot of rapid prototyping, I have made essentially no effort to produce clean code here (or a clean git history). Additionally, a large amount of code is inherited from the original StarGAN implementation. Individual experiments exist as branches or tags.
