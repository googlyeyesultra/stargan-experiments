Original has convolution artifacts presumably from Conv2dTranspose.

Autoencoder ran in 10:16 on celeba. Original ran in 10:22. Probably not significant - running on shared machines.
Autoencoder results very similar but probably a tiny bit worse. Can try FID/etc. to actually evaluate.
    Certainly close enough to be worth considering.
    
Upsample and deg_1 have very poor performance. Upsample with deg_2 and deg_3 seems to work okay.
Bilinear and learned bilinear both perform poorly.

Degree 3 is sometimes better than original, though there are occasional spots it visibly misbehaves a little bit.]
    Basically, doesn't have checkerboard artifacts, and hews closer to original image.
    But has spots where it recolors wrong thing or doesn't change something it should.
