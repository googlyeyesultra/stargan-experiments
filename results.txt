Original has convolution artifacts presumably from Conv2dTranspose.

Autoencoder ran in 10:16 on celeba. Original ran in 10:22. Probably not significant - running on shared machines.
Autoencoder results very similar but probably a tiny bit worse. Can try FID/etc. to actually evaluate.
    Certainly close enough to be worth considering.
